Starting in the NE portion of the city
Decently close to the collegium
Being hosted by a friendly tiefling family

[[Knuckletooth]] is dead?

travelers marks of a river and a road come up in almost every scene.
The city keeps getting burned down and rebuilt
Always kobalds show back up and experience some kind of grief, either dieing or being rebuffed

Creatures with large gray horns open the road, always during the dark portion of twilight hours.

Who was the last person to travel the road
faceless pale figure kicked out of a palace and appearing in a city of people
his house burning down and his followers dispersing

Currently mid afternoon

Jackie was told:
Tell anyone that asks that Ottily Riverbend has entrusted we couriers to deliver this message to her brother directly

The ambassador may be able to corroborate this.


She told Ash:
A road can have many entrances and looks different  at different times
It is very dark, there may be monsters
Note needs to go to the shadow court to her brother


A shifty looking gnome leaves the inn as we get back

A package of sheets of a familiar mesh of heavy metal
> For better sleep: Baerik
> ps: I've learned something useful and included an omen (to be opened when we are on our way to the shadow road)

The metal plates can be used to line to room to sleep.
