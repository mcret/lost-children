[[Ember]] spotted the shadow road, the specific path that seems to be followed

We follow it out of the city's ruins through grasslands and come upon an _actively maintained_ stone structure that will provide protection from the elements right at the edge of a darker forest.
Into the forest we come upon a dried creek bed. Ash climbs down and back up the other side.

A thin white mist rises from the ground and something is crashing through the undergrowth. A giant appears, then a second giant

One of the giants hit Ash's shield (for half damage), knocking him off the path. Genie smoke bleeds from Ash's eyes as he casts hellish rebuke.
[[Infernus]] (Ash's patron), notices ash for the first time in a while, and, telling Ash that he is in the middle of fulfilling a wish, implies the spear should be acquired.

Ash tries to get the spear away from the giant with [[Ezekiel]]'s help, but is unable.

Ember _suggests_ the giants leave the spear and go take a nap.
Ezekiel grabs the spear and sens it to Infernus.

Then a shadowy, panther-like creature appeared with some kind of purple magic.

Ash blasts it in a pit and it dies

We almost run through a gate with some sticky black magic stuff that is hard to get off
ended up going around the gate

end session
