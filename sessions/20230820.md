We find the lych gate by brute force on the interior of the ghetto illuminated by a ruby filtered light.

Traced out fey runes and trying to figure stuff out, but it fades

Ember notices a tiefling boy watching us while we investigate the gate.

Ash was able to use the old wizard-ruins-repurposing book to figure out which parts of the gate are still active/reactive to magic.

The boy pops up above the lych gate. Ash gives him a silver to show us if the gate can do anything. He takes us to the other side (outside) and shows us a set of sections that are light and dark and light and dark. The boy does a finger-coin trick that makes the images appear to move.

Ash lights a coin, smears mud on one side, and flips it. Some of the runes light up, Ash deciphers what kind of magic it is (illusion), and Zafira reads them.

Ash writes down details about finding other locations

Ash has heard about a different kind of spellcaster that knows a ritual that can make a _creation_ spell permanent, that some warlocks, frustrated with their patron, have sought out

Kid's name is Gon. Ash misty-steps "through" the gate, and that got Gon's attention. He ran off, and brought several children, who barraged us with information about the gate, some of which is useful, some of which is not.

A pair of tiefling adults are keeping an eye on the kids

1 rotation per 3 seconds kindof starts to activate the gate, but something fundamental is missing.

Ember is the same kind of tiefling as most of those in the area.
Two of them, Ankus and Amarius, talk to us. They are nervous about newcomers, and seemed to not like the scathseidh

Ember __SMASHES__ a persuasion check and we go to one of their houses. Dometia, a portly woman, dotes on Ember. They explain the history of the area

About 50 years ago there was a major tiefling exodus from somewhere to here, several of them made friends with kobalds.

The gate has been the seen of proposals, executions, "ride by shootings". The wall records major happening by itself. They explain in detail how to activate the magic of the gate.

The ritual specific to the [Lych Gate], which has another name
The Slaugh's Window
Sometimes when it is actived it shows [Knuckletooth], sometimes [The dragged woman] she sometime helps people for a price, but that help is only available once. She is powerful, but antisocial.

[Knuckletooth] doesn't really dislike people, he just doesn't like getting exposed.
