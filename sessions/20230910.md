We show up in the ruins of a town
There's a marionette stand with chicken bones
A familiar temple with a curtain and a beheaded statue from the temple of the god of light from the early session.
The ruins of something like [[Zobec]], but rearranged.
A flash of light brightens the area in front of us
We see shadowy shapes floating about, they are incorporeal and don't interact with us. They seem slightly attracted to us, but not focused

Arms, body, and a head form in front of us, with pitch black voids for eyes, screams _revenge_ and attacks us.
We are _technically_ "in" the material plane. It is a demiplane

A death wisp and two ghouls attack us
one ghoul adds

Death wisps are nasty. [[Ash]] does not like them.
