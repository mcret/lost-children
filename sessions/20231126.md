[[Ash]] flies around the the outside. 
* sees a salon (space 50) through a stained glass window
	* scene of dogs and elves hunting a great stag
* space 62 with a very formal sitting room comparable to a throne room
	* perches such as for an owl
	* checkered black and white tiles on the floor
		* polished
	* jewels on the ceiling like glowing stars

[[Ember]] went back to the stables and could begin to see the horse through the moonlight
She put a drop in each eye at which point [[JJ]] instructed [[Joshua Chester]] to deafen for a moment
At 9 pm, [[Bella]] started playing with her sound car
[[Ember]] used the last of the drops in her ear and mouth. We walked out to the courtyard, and she made a perception check

This place is _really_ busy
two small green dragons above the entrance
someone disappeared through the door
a small fox laying _on_ [[Ezekiel]], like a pillow
painter above the stable with a very large paint brush
blacksmith in the forge

[[Ember]] goes to the door and gently touches it. Nothing happens. She goes back to the courtyard and takes about an hour and a half to make more distilled moonlight

Another nat 1 for -1 animal handling to touch the horse after trying to get the moon juice in my eyes.
[[Ash]] is now covered in horse snot

There's a single blue butterfly that flies down to room 5
