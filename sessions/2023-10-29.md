At some point in the past we left the shadow road and entered the plane [[The Shadow Realm]]

The front gate we came in through is now closed and sealed
There are now two more guards in place at the main front door

[[Ash]] knocks at the door again, [[Ember]] says we are there on invitation of [[Audely Riverbend]], number one attacks. Ash knock again after tanking a hit, say we came of our own volition. Number 2 attacks

Ash is attacked by an "empty cloak", which he posits may be of interest to [[Infernus]]. He pulls it into his ring and returns to combat.

Ash takes a piece of the metal of one of the constructs and smears ash on his hands and lower forearms.
