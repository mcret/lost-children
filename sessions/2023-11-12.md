A new set of armor is guarding the now-open front gate

I asked the owls if we were going to stand around all day, or if we are going to fight

One throws a partially eaten apple at me

[[Ember]] uses speak with animals talks to the birds
They have been out hunting, and are sharing their spoils with the goblins

[[Revich]] is "an all seeing angel" that lives in a tower of light

[[Ash]] wonders into the stables and finds a blue horse with white shoes
nat 1 on animal handling...[[Ash]] shocked the horse

[[Ember]] talks to a spider and a frog. She can't perceive the horse. The from and the spider. They have not heard anything about a tower of light or an all seeing angel, but possibly heard the name before. They frog is the spider's friend. The spider pets the frog.

Saw a goblin in the kitchen

[[Ember]]attempts to bottle the moonlight

in (space 4) there are corpses, heads, etc 
the gate behind the armor is open
the armor says guests are permitted past, but I am not a guest, nor am I allowed

[[Ash]] leaves and asks the armor at the gate if it speaks (it does)
The armor's master is [[The Nails Smith]]

[[Ash]] messes with it for a bit, and then it realizes we were given a day to do our business, and with an epic fail on an eldritch blast, [[Ash]] is invited to leave.

[[Ember]] is able to distill a few ml of moonlight. She goes and asks [[Crowbeak]] what she can do with the moonlight

Perfect vision through this, just like if we were out hunting under bright moonlight
