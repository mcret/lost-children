Fishing place next to [[Knuckletooth]]'s house

	- crazy person about a lych walking through the street...or maybe it was a lamp post
	- something something [[Knuckletooth]]'s house
	- knows a guy telephone about the [[Arcane Collegium]]

Went to the [[Arcane Collegium]]
- Looked for info about the [[Lych Gate]]
- directed to [[Gary]]'s "friend (grad student)
	- they are unsure of where it is, but there is some fey [[Knuckletooth]] in the city who told an apprentice about a ritual that can be done at it
	- the apprentice left for [[Siwal]] (place) and no info about it left at the library
- Threw every keyword at the grad student
	- he is particularly interested in performing the ritual
	- looking for evidence of how to do it or of it having been done
	- some kind of extremely powerful teleportation magic
	- research has been shut down
	- grad student hasn't risked asking because they don't want to get on the bad side of [[Glennanen Phylinandron]]
	- gave some names of folks in various departments
