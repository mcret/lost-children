[[JJ]] got some descriptions of [[Ash]] and [[Ember]].
The party walked on and eventually came to a city guarded with a large humanoid construct that tells us
> the court grants you one night's rest, you must leave come morning.

In the city:
* A white-barked tree with red and silver flowers
* Several yert-like shelters

We knock on the door (location 13), and are asked
> How has invited you to the shadow court?

* [[Ember]] said [[Audely Riverbend]] and nothing happened
* [[Ash]] said [[Glennanen Phylinandron]], and combat started
