Mephistopheles -> [[Jamethenal]]

We are going from the [[Lych Gate]] to the river towards the north where it was freezing from

We find a pier with arcane marks that we can't quite identify

our note from [[Baerik]] helped us realize this may be a place to cross over
we get a boat from a nearby kobald to float under the pier

We open the note, which provides the sacrifice aspect of the ritual. Ash flips a coin and finally opens the gate

We learned the 4th level Conjuration spell:
Tread the Niffleheim Road
