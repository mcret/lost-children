- The home or office of [[../people/Glennanen Phylinandron]]. Burned and abandoned in a fight with the group.
- A hidden door engraved and embedded with mythril and gems had the message
> These chambers are not for you mortals
- Time seemed to move faster for the interior
- There was a glamour of some sort hiding the burnt nature after the group returned
